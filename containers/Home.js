            To invest is to allocate money in the expectation of some benefit in the future.

            In finance, the benefit from an investment is called a return. The return may consist of a gain (or
            loss)
            realised from the sale of property or an investment, unrealised capital appreciation (or depreciation),
            or
            investment income such as dividends, interest, rental income etc., or a combination of capital gain and
            income. The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange
            rates.

            Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. When we make a low risk investment,
            the
            return is also generally low.

            Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to adopt a particular investment strategy and
            diversify
            their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

            A financial investment is an asset that you put money into with the hope that it will grow or appreciate
            into a larger sum of money. The idea is that you can later sell it at a higher price or earn money on it
            while you own it. You may be looking to grow something over the next year, such as saving up for a car,
            or over the next 30 years, such as saving for retirement.

            How you invest these dollars can be very different. How much time you have on your side is often a key
            thing to consider when making a financial investment. The more time you have, the more risk you can
            usually take. The more risk you take, the more potential for making more money! It is important to note
            that there is also an economic definition of financial investments that deals with how businesses invest
            in products, equipment, factories, employees, and inventories. This lesson will focus on the finance
            definition of financial investment. Let's look at a few key terms worth knowing when it comes to
            financial investments.

            Appreciation is the amount an investment grows in value. For example, you buy a share of stock for $10,
            and a year later it is worth $15; the stock has appreciated $5.

            Dividends are usually cash payments that are paid out on financial investments based on the success and
            earnings of a company. For example, you invest in Microsoft stock, and it may pay you a dividend of $5 a
            share. If you owned 500 shares you would get paid 500 * $5 which is $2,500!

            Interest is the fee a bank, institution, or government pays you for loaning them money through the
            purchase of a CD or bond. You can also earn small amounts of interest on a checking or savings account.
            For example, you may have $10,000 in government savings bonds that pays 5% interest annually; that adds
            up to $500 a year!
