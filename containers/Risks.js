        Definition: Investment risk can be defined as the probability or likelihood of occurrence of losses relative to the expected return on any particular investment.

Description: Stating simply, it is a measure of the level of uncertainty of achieving the returns as per the expectations of the investor. It is the extent of unexpected results to be realized.
